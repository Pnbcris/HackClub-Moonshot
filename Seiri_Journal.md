## **October 19th : Brainstorm Project + Working on Logos**
I began today with trying to figure out what my project should even be about. I tried using Notion + Google Calendar to track my activity and create a gantt chart, yet after a couple hours, I gave up, simply because its too time consuming and every iteration of trying to get it to function together ends up taking too long to update/never updates. So I believe that is what my project would surround, creating a more responsive student friendly application which could remove the additional headaches that come with personal planners. I also believe it would be a great touch to also iterate other features that would help with academic success; could be flash cards, a pomodoro timer or simply notepad boards; whatever one might desire for the most optimal organization, it would be there; It's definetly an ambitious goal but its worth a shot;

The first step I wanted to embark on was coming up with a name for said project; I dont want the name to be too long; I would prefer it to be easy to remember, or at least hold its significance; after a while, I landed on the word "Seiri", which is a term that means "sorting." idealy it is also one of the first steps in the 5S methodology. Not to get too off topic but it feels appropriate; so with the following hour, I designed a logo for a banner/icon of the web/app on Aseprite;
