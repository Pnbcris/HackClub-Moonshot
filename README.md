Repository of my submissions to Moonshot Challenge!
  ## **Project #1: Seiri - an Academic + Personal organizer app!** 

  ### goals

- create an easy + efficient way to organize tasks, recieve notifications of future and pending goals
- provide API support for other websites
- combining schedules from Google Calendar, Canvas + other work places all in one
- if time permits: create hardware that integrates and connects solely to the web app software, creating a dedicated taskbar, away from your monitor/screen in an effort to create a cool + customizable UI with tons of opportunities for personalization
